#work between files/folders:

besides all default files django created for you, some folder/files still needed:
a template folder to store all html files. html controls the looks and have links to other pages.
hub.py file with functions to take requests from url and run codes then connect to coresponding html files.

in urls.py file, need to import hub.py because all names declared inside hub.py

in urls.py, path('about/', hub.about, name='about')
                 'about/' is when this word inside the address bar
                 hub.about is use the .about function inside hub.py
                 name='about' give this path a name for refering anywhere in your project
                 
                 
in hub.py, declare functions like:  
                                    def home(request):
                                        return render(request, 'home.html', {'keyword':dosomething})
                                        

=== html ===

<a href="{% url 'about'%}">about</a>
<a.../a>   a link
href   hyper reference link: "  "
